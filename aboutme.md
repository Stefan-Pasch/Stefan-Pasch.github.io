title: About me

I am a **Data Scientist** at SVA, a German IT consulting firm. Before that I obtained my **PhD in Economics** where I applied data science techniques on research topics such as finance, HR, and the consequences of digitalization. I combine state-of-the-art machine learning technologies with economic and strategic management theory to optimize business processes or provide actionable insights for executives. 

I am specialized in applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** in both my work and research:
- As part of my consulting practice, I trained and implemented a state-of-the-art transformer-based language model for automated question answering at a German financial public institution. 
- Moreover, at SVA, I fine-tuned and applied various NLP methods on **Sustainable Finance (ESG)**, including text classification, zero-shot classification, sentiment analyses, and semantic search. 
- Also in my spare time, I conduct research on deep learning-based language models. For example, I trained and evaluated language models on information from financial news to predict stock price movements. 

Beyond NLP, I work on managing large data sources efficiently and to make ML models production ready using technologies like AWS, Databricks, and NVIDIA Deep Learning.

To me, the current advancements in Machine Learning, particularly transformer-based models, resemble a new gold rush. Hence, I am very passionate in applying these tools to new fields to either gather interesting new insights or to provide business value. In my spare time, I enjoy football, bouldering, discussions on economics and politics, and always a nice cup of coffee.
